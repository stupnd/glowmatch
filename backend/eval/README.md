# Evaluation

Two harnesses, answering different questions.

| | `classifier_eval.py` | `run_eval.py` |
|---|---|---|
| Measures | LAB value → MST level | photograph → MST level |
| Needs photos | no | **yes** |
| Status | **done** — see [docs/classifier-evaluation.md](../../docs/classifier-evaluation.md) | **blocked on data** |

The split exists because `classify_mst` takes a colour, not an image. That stage
can be characterised exactly, today, and it already produced a real finding. The
end-to-end question — how accurately the pipeline recovers a colour from a
photograph — is the one that needs labelled faces, and it is unanswered.

## Running what works now

```bash
cd backend
python eval/classifier_eval.py                    # report
python eval/classifier_eval.py --json out.json    # machine-readable
```

## Running the end-to-end harness

```bash
python eval/run_eval.py                 # refuses on placeholder data
python eval/run_eval.py --lighting warm
python eval/run_eval.py --json report.json --verbose
```

It **refuses to report accuracy** while the test set is placeholders. A number
computed over five 74-byte JPEGs looks exactly like a real result, and a fake
accuracy figure is worse than an absent one. `--allow-placeholders` exercises
the harness itself; the output is meaningless by construction.

## Collecting samples

### What to aim for

**Five per MST level, minimum — 50 samples.** Fewer than five gives per-level
confidence intervals too wide to act on.

Per-level coverage is not optional here. The classifier's reliability varies
by more than 2× across the scale (crowded reference values at MST 1–3, noisier
measurement at MST 9–10), so a pooled accuracy number averages over the exact
thing worth knowing. `run_eval.py` prints which levels are missing and says
plainly that unmeasured is not the same as accurate.

Spread each level across the three lighting tags (`neutral`, `warm`, `low`).
Warm and cool casts are what break MST 1–4 in the stage-level results, so
neutral-only data will overstate accuracy.

### Where samples can come from

Ranked by how defensible the labels are:

1. **Licensed research datasets with skin-tone annotations.** Best labels,
   clearest provenance. Check each licence permits your use — several are
   research-only, which is fine here and not fine in a deployed product.
2. **Self-captured with a colour reference card in frame.** A card (X-Rite
   ColorChecker or similar) lets you white-balance against ground truth rather
   than eyeballing, which is the main weakness of hand-labelling.
3. **Consented photos from people you know.** Get consent in writing, for this
   specific use, and record it.

**Do not** scrape faces off the internet. Beyond the legal problem, the labels
would be your guesses about strangers, which is precisely the judgement this
system is supposed to be tested against.

### Labelling honestly

MST labels are perceptual, and self-identification differs from third-party
assignment. Two things help:

- **Prefer self-identified labels** where the subject can give one.
- **Record disagreement rather than averaging it away.** If two labellers
  disagree between MST 5 and 6, that boundary is genuinely ambiguous, and
  within-±1 accuracy is the honest metric there.

### Adding a sample

```bash
python eval/add_sample.py \
  --image ~/photos/img_001.jpg \
  --mst 7 \
  --lighting warm \
  --source "colleague-consented" \
  --consent explicit \
  --coverage
```

`--source` and `--consent` are required. Provenance for a dataset of people's
faces cannot be reconstructed after the fact, so it is captured at entry.

`--coverage` prints progress toward five per level:

```
  MST  7  [###..] 3  needs 2 more
```

### Privacy

`eval/images/` currently ships only placeholders. **Think before committing real
faces to a public repository** — consent to being in your test set is not
consent to being on GitHub. Options:

- keep `eval/images/` local and gitignored, sharing `test_set.json` only
- store crops of skin patches rather than identifiable faces
- use a private repository for the dataset and reference it

The harness reads paths from `test_set.json`, so any of these works without
code changes.

## Interpreting results

`run_eval.py` reports:

- **exact** and **within ±1** accuracy — within-1 is the fairer headline, since
  adjacent MST levels are genuinely ambiguous at the boundaries
- **by MST level** — the breakdown that matters
- **by lighting**
- **a confusion matrix** — direction of error. Systematically predicting low on
  deep tones is a different failure from noise, and only the matrix shows it.

Compare against `docs/classifier-evaluation.md`. If end-to-end accuracy is much
worse than the stage-level result predicts, the error is upstream — face
detection, patch sampling, or white balance — not in the classifier.

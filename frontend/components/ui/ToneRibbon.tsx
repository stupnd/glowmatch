/**
 * The Monk Skin Tone scale as a visual signature.
 *
 * Every product in this space uses stock beauty photography, which is why they
 * all look alike. Tinted's actual subject is the scale itself — ten measured
 * colours — so the interface is built from that rather than decorated with
 * something borrowed. The same ribbon recurs on the welcome page, during
 * analysis, and in results, which is what makes those screens feel like one
 * product instead of three.
 *
 * MST-1 through MST-10, from Monk et al. (2023). These are the exact values the
 * classifier targets, so the decoration is the data.
